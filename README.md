# VIM settings

This started off as a git repo of my vim settings. It's sort of expanded since
then...

I've added scripts for setting up new machines but they're still fairly
experimental. For now it's best to clone this repo first:

    git clone https://github.com/kohrVid/vim-settings.git; cd vim-settings

To install on a debian machine:

    ./new_debian_machine_setup.sh

arch:

    ./new_arch_machine_setup.sh

macOS:

    ./new_mac_machine_setup.sh
